# No More Titles
A small tool that creates an image similar to the title cards of [No More Jockeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/nomorejockeys).

- Allows the user to input the category to be displayed
- Exports to PNG

This was a short project so the images produced aren't perfectly 1 to 1, but I think they're faithful enough.

## Build
No binaries are supplied, so to use, please install rust and in the root folder run:

`cargo run --release`
